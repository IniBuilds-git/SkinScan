## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IniBuilds-git/SkinScan
cd SkinScan
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the dataset:
   - Download the [Skin Disease Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pacificrm/skindiseasedataset)
   - Extract it to the `data/raw/` directory

5. Run the notebook files step by step from data exploration, to data preprocessing and training, to model evaluation


7. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

8. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## Usage

1. **Upload an image** of the affected skin area using the web interface
2. **Wait for analysis** as the AI processes the image
3. **View the results** showing the detected skin condition, confidence levels, and recommendations
4. **Read additional information** about the condition and next steps

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Training Process

The model was trained using a two-phase approach:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Initial training with a frozen EfficientNet-B0 base model and custom classification head
2. **Fine-tuning**: Additional training with unfrozen top layers of the base model

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 92.3% on the test set
- **Precision**: 0.91 weighted average
- **Recall**: 0.89 weighted average
- **F1-Score**: 0.90 weighted average

## Ethical Considerations

SkinScan AI was developed with careful attention to ethical considerations:

- **Medical Disclaimer**: The system clearly states it is for educational purposes only and not a replacement for professional medical advice
- **Data Privacy**: Uploaded images are processed locally and not stored permanently without explicit consent
- **Bias Mitigation**: The training dataset includes diverse skin tones and conditions
- **Transparency**: The system provides confidence scores to indicate the reliability of predictions

## Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset with more diverse skin conditions and skin tones
- Implement more advanced model architectures and ensemble techniques
- Develop a mobile application for improved accessibility
- Add symptom tracking functionality for monitoring progress over time
- Integrate with telemedicine platforms for seamless doctor consultations
